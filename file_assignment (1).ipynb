        "\n",
        "Memory management in Python can be tricky due to several factors, especially since Python is a high-level language that handles a lot of things automatically, like garbage collection and dynamic memory allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "some challenges associated with memory management:\n",
        "\n",
        " **Automatic Garbage Collection:**\n",
        "\n",
        " Python uses automatic garbage collection to free up memory. This means that unused objects are automatically destroyed, but it’s not always perfect.\n",
        "\n",
        " *** Memory Overhead:***\n",
        "\n",
        " Python objects often have a higher memory overhead compared to other languages (like C or C++) due to its dynamic nature. Each object in Python is a container with extra information (such as reference count and type info), which means even simple objects can consume more memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Memory Fragmentation :**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dynamic nature of Python’s memory allocation can cause fragmentation, especially when objects of various sizes are frequently allocated and deallocated. The Python memory allocator may not always find perfectly aligned free blocks to allocate new objects, which can lead to inefficient memory usage\n",
        "\n",
        "**Memory Leaks from Third-Party Libraries:**\n",
        "\n",
        " Sometimes, memory leaks are not due to Python’s own garbage collection, but rather due to bugs in third-party libraries or bindings to C code (like NumPy or other C-extension modules). These libraries might not manage memory properly, leading to resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Large Objects and Data Structures:**\n",
        "\n",
        " Managing large objects (e.g., large lists or dictionaries) can be difficult, as Python’s default data structures (like lists and dictionaries) can be memory-inefficient for very large datasets.\n",
